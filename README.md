# Welcome to Rock / Scissors / Paper Game

This project was developed to satisfy the second Milestone Project requirements for the Full Stack Software Developement program at the [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net). As a second project, this site is created using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript languages.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of how JavaScript is implemented and interpreted by the browser. In this example I have chosen to create a simple game of Rock / Scissors / Paper to demonstrate this understanding.

# Instructions

The purpose of the Rock Paper Scissors game is to create a scene where the participants throw a series of moves in order to crush each other. The participants are usually two, and hand gestures represent their moves. The Rock Paper Scissors game has three moves represented by the “Rock,” the “Paper,” and the “Scissors.” The Rock is the move thrown by clenching the fist. The Paper is the move thrown by outstretching your hand. The Scissors is exhibited by using the thumb to hold down the ring finger and pinky while allowing space between the index and middle fingers as they point toward the opponent.

The basic rules are as follows: "Rock" beats "Scissors". "Scissors" beats "Paper" and "Paper" beats "Rock".

For a full version of the rules please visit the "World Rock Paper Scissors Association webite; [WRPS Association](https://wrpsa.com) 

# User Stories
## Prospective User

I am a prospective Rock Scisorrs Paper fan and want to be able to:

* Immediately view the home page and identify the basic rules of playing the game.
* I am a keen gamer and will want to know in more detail about the rules of the game and how I can become an association member.
* I will want to easily see the start game button to begin a new game which will direct me to the game page.
* On the game page I will identify the selections available to me via an image representation of "Rock", "Scissors" and "Paper".
* At the top of the page I will see the selection results made my myself and my competitor and the result of "Win", "Loose", or "Draw" displayed.
* Below this view section, I will see a scoreboard tallying up the scores from both players and for draws.
* First of the 3 'options' to arrive at 5 points will determine the result of the game.
* Once 5 points is reached I will see a modal popup which will prevent me from carrying on with the selections and the game will stop.
* The modal popup will provide me with a choice of either starting a new game or returning to the home page.
